**AndroGuardian** is a responsive, front-end virus and bug scanning simulation tool designed with educational and UI/UX goals in mind. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides an intuitive platform for simulating the behavior of a malware scanner with animations, dashboards, and multiple scan types.

Created by **Vatsal Gavit**, 11th-grade student from Dang, Gujarat, India. 🚀

> 🧪 This project is **a frontend simulation only** — it does not perform real-time scanning or threat detection. It's perfect for UI demos, mockups, and practice.
